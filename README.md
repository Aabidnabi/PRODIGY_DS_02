# PRODIGY_DS_02
# Titanic Dataset Exploration and Cleaning
# Overview
This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary goal is to delve into the dataset, identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables, and subsequently clean the data to facilitate further analysis.

# Dataset
The Titanic dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed here. It consists of various features related to passengers aboard the Titanic, including information such as age, sex, ticket class, and survival status.

# Getting Started
